abstract: "Parasitism has strong effects on community dynamics. Given the detrimental effects parasites have on host health, infection or infestation might be expected to reduce upper thermal limits, increasing the vulnerability of host species to future climate change. Copepods are integral components of aquatic food webs and biogeochemical cycles. They also serve as intermediate hosts in the life cycle of parasitic isopods. Given the important roles they play in aquatic communities, it is important to understand factors that affect their thermal limits in order to better predict how community dynamics may change in a warming climate. Here we examined the effect of parasitism by larvae of a bopyrid isopod on the critical thermal limits of the cosmopolitan copepod *Acartia tonsa*. We test the hypothesis that infestation reduces thermal limits. To aid with this work, we developed an affordable, highly portable method for measuring critical thermal maxima of small ectotherms. While small in number, we also used meta-analysis to summarize the results of previous studies examining the effects of parasitism on critical thermal maxima to help contextualize our findings. Contrary to both our hypothesis and the results of previous studies, we observed no reduction of thermal limits by parasitism in *A. tonsa*. These results suggest that life history of the host and parasite may interact to determine how infestation affects environmental sensitivity."

# Introduction

Species interactions are integral factors in ecological dynamics. Understanding how species interactions may affect sensitivity to environmental conditions is therefore critical for robust predictions about the effects of climate change on population and community dynamics. Parasitism can have a wide range of effects on community dynamics [@hatcher2012; @thomas2005]. By nature of its detrimental effects on host health and energy reserves, one way in which parasitism might be expected to affect ecological dynamics is by modifying host sensitivity to changing conditions [@hector2021]. In particular, vulnerability to temperature extremes is important to understand given the rapid increases in average temperatures and the increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme events like heatwaves [@frolicher2018; @johnson2020].

For a limited range of host and parasite taxa, previous studies have observed an increase in host temperature sensitivity as a result of parasitization [@hector2021]. More generally, however, parasites have been shown to elicit a wide range of molecular, physiological, and behavioral responses in the host [@wertheim2022; @hurd2001; @heil2016; @wertheim2005; @doublet2017; @fuess2021; @frank2013; @laverty2017; @diaz-morales2023]. These diverse responses may alter how parasitism affects host thermal limits. For example, parasitization-induced increases in heat shock protein expression may enable the host to better respond to acute temperature stress [@encomio2007; @selbach2020]. As parasitism is widely observed across taxa, examining the diverse responses to infection or infestation and how these feedback onto environmental sensitivity may have important consequences for our understanding of how communities will respond to climate change.

Copepods play important roles in coastal marine systems. Pelagic calanoid copepods serve as the intermediate host for parasitic isopods in the family Bopyridae [@mauchline1998], some of which infest commercially harvested decapods as their final host [@conner2010; @somers1991; @roccatagliata1999; @vinuesa2010; @shields2012]. As in other systems, less attention has been paid to the effects these parasites have on their intermediate hosts. *Acartia tonsa* is an especially prominent species across the coastal Western Atlantic [@turner1981], and is known to be the intermediate host for several species of bopyrid isopods [@dale1982]. Previous work has shown that parasitism by isopod larvae reduces metabolic rates in *A. tonsa* [@anderson1975]. In other species of copepods, parasitism by isopod larvae induces infertility [@uye1997]. In rapidly warming coastal systems, parasitism-induced reductions in host thermal limits may have substantial effects on food web and biogeochemical dynamics.

Given the important role *Acartia* copepods play in these systems, we aim to test the hypothesis that infestation by bopyrid isopod larvae reduces thermal limits in *Acartia tonsa*. We also contextualize our findings using a meta-analysis of the effects of parasitism on critical thermal maxima. Surprisingly, we find that parasitism does not reduce thermal limits in *A. tonsa* females. This is in stark contrast to the findings of previous studies, which have generally found that parasitism reduces critical thermal maxima. This may reflect differential effects of parasites on the temperature sensitivity of final and intermediate hosts. In any case, the deviation of our results from those of previous studies highlights the importance of examining the effects of parasitism on thermal limits across diverse taxa.

# Methods

## Animal Collection

Copepods were collected from Key Largo, Florida in late February 2023 (25.283775N, -80.330165W; water temperature: 27°C; salinity: 27 psu). A substantial portion of adult *A. tonsa* females bore larvae of a bopyrid isopod attached to their prosome (Figure 1), likely *Probopyrus floridensis* [@dale1982]. While we did not plan on collecting infested copepods, this allowed us to opportunistically examine the effects of parasitism on individual thermal limits. After collection, the contents of the plankton tow were maintained at 22°C. An aquarium bubbler was used to ensure constant aeration. Mature *Acartia tonsa* females were sorted from the bulk contents of the plankton tow. Females with a bopyrid isopod larva attached to their prosome were kept separate. Individual thermal limits were measured in batches of ten (five each with and without isopods).

## CT~max~ Device Description

Critical thermal maxima (CT~max~) are measured using a dynamic ramping assay, and indicate the maximum temperature at which an individual can maintain normal activity [@lutterschmidt1997; @cowles1944]. These measurements are commonly used across a wide range of taxa [@bennett2018]. Copepod thermal limits are still relatively uncommon, however, despite their abundance, distribution, and ecological importance [@sasaki2021]. We have developed a highly portable system to assist with making thermal limit measurements in copepods and other small ectotherms, suitable for both rapid measurements made near field sites and for use in more controlled laboratory settings.

The system has three components: a reservoir, a water bath, and a temperature sensor. We used a 5-gallon bucket covered with a neoprene sleeve as our reservoir. The reservoir is filled with \~20 L of water, which is slowly warmed using a 300-watt aquarium water heater. The reservoir also contains two aquarium pumps, one of which vigorously circulates water within the reservoir while the other pumps water from the reservoir into the water bath, which sits atop the reservoir. In this arrangement, the temperature ramping rate is determined by the interaction between the power output of the aquarium heater and the volume of water in the reservoir, enabling users to alter ramping rates by using heaters with different outputs. The water bath is a transparent plexiglass box that fits over the opening of the reservoir. Water is pumped up from the reservoir, flooding the water bath. A recession cut into one edge allows water to spill back into the reservoir. The water bath contains several test tube holders that are used to secure the experimental vessels (50 mL flat-bottom glass vials). Because the box is transparent, individuals are easily monitored through the side of the water bath throughout the trial, eliminating the necessity to remove experimental vessels and any resulting temperature fluctuations. The final component of this apparatus is a small Arduino computer system that logs temperature with three independent sensors at 5 second intervals. A detailed description of the sensor components and construction is provided in Supplemental Material. These sensors are small enough to be placed inside the glass vials, providing a continuous record of the temperatures throughout the assay. Data is written to a microUSB card for easy access. No horizontal gradients in temperature were detected within the water bath, and temperatures are averaged across the three sensors. A major advantage of this system is the portability - most of the components fit within the empty 5-gallon bucket, allowing for secure transport or shipping. The cost of the unit is also relatively low (\~\$400 per unit at the time of publication; see Supplementary Materials for a complete list of components).

## Measuring CT~max~

We selected a ramping rate of 0.1-0.3°C per minute. This ramping rate has been used previously to estimate CT~max~ in copepods [@harada2019; @jiang2009]. To initiate each CT~max~ assay, ten copepods (five bearing isopods and five without) were placed individually into glass tubes with 10 mL of 0.2 um filtered seawater collected from the same location as the copepods. After a brief resting phase, the water heater was turned on, initiating the temperature ramp. Simultaneously, the temperature logger began to record temperature and a stopwatch began recording the time passed. Individuals were then continuously monitored as water temperature increased. Copepods not actively moving were checked by rotating the glass vial, causing slight water movement. In active copepods, this stimulus is sufficient to elicit a jump response. The time at which an individual stopped responding to this stimulus was recorded (in minutes and seconds). In addition to unresponsiveness, other indications that an individual had reached their CT~max~ were i) a sustained position on the floor of the vessel, ii) antennules that had curved inwards, were held flat against the prosome, or were held at abnormal backwards angles, and iii) a backwards arching of the urosome above the prosome. After an individual reached its CT~max~, the glass vial it was held in was removed from the water bath.

Once the assay was completed, the recorded times were converted to individual CT~max~ values in °C using the continuous temperature record logged by the Arduino system. We used this time-based method instead of directly monitoring the temperature for two reasons: 1) it was faster to record the time an individual stopped responding than to check the temperature readings from the three sensors, increasing the resolution of our measurements; and 2) it reduced sub-conscious bias stemming from past knowledge or expectations about copepod thermal limits. To estimate CT~max~ we averaged the temperature readings from the three individual sensors over a period directly preceding the time the individual ceased responding to stimuli. This period extended from the time at which an individual was recorded as having stopped responding to stimulus to the last time the individual was checked. As it takes around 5 seconds to check each individual for a response, the duration of this window was estimated for each individual as the number of vials remaining in the water bath when it reached its CT~max~, multiplied by 5 seconds. As such, the uncertainty window decreased in length as the trial went on, until, for the final individual the window includes just the amount of time it took to check whether the individual had stopped responding.

## Statistical Analysis

The CT~max~ values for the two groups (infected and non-infected) were compared using mean difference as an effect size estimate. Confidence intervals were estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping [@ho2019]. Since multiple replicate experiments were run and CT~max~ may have changed as time since collection increased, we also ran a linear mixed effects model, with CT~max~ modeled as a function of infection status with experimental replicate as a random effect.

## Meta-Analysis

In order to compare the effects we observed here with previous work, we also conducted a small meta-analysis. Potential studies were obtained with a Web of Science search for "(CTmax OR"upper thermal limit" OR "thermal tolerance") AND parasit\*" on March 6th, 2023. This yielded 132 results, which were individually screened for inclusion in the meta-analysis. In order to be included, a study must have reported CT~max~ values for both infected and uninfected host animals. We used strict inclusion criteria to maximize comparability (excluding studies that measured thermal limits in time to knockdown, or percent survivorship after static temperature exposure, etc.). A total of five previously published studies met these criteria. Mean thermal limits, standard deviations, and sample sizes were extracted from the study text or tables, or were manually calculated using the raw data. We then estimated standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval for each comparison between infected and non-infected animals using the *metafor* package [@viechtbauer2010].

# Results

## CT~max~ Values

Using the set up described above, we were able to gradually increase the temperature of the water within the vials (Supp. Fig. 1a). Ramping rates are always within the 0.1-0.3°C per minute range, but due to the imperfect insulation of the reservoir, these rates decreased slightly over time from \\\~0.25°C to \\\~0.2°C (Supp. Fig. 1b). Contrary to expectations, we did not observe a decrease in thermal limits in the infected copepods (Figure 2). Instead, the observed effect of bopyrid parasitism on CT~max~ was slightly positive, with a confidence interval that strongly overlapped zero (mean difference: 0.102; 95CI -0.211 - 0.353). The linear mixed effect model also indicated no effect of bopyrid infestation (p = 0.48). This result is strongly affected by three parasitized individuals with substantially lower thermal limits. When these thermal limits are removed, there is a small positive effect of infection (mean effect: 0.295; 95CI 0.0983 - 0.509). With the three low values removed, the linear mixed effects model also indicates an effect of bopyrid infestation on CT~max~ (p = 0.006).

## Meta-Analysis

Five studies met our criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis, yielding 15 contrasts between an infected and uninfected host animal. In cases were studies reported multiple experimental treatments (ex - ramping rates) only one set of measurements was included per host-parasite pair, selected to represent intermediate conditions. The studies included in the meta-analysis generally focused on amphibian parasitization by fungal or protistan parasites [@sherman2008; @greenspan2017; @fernandez-loras2019], but also included studies examining an arthropod host and bacterial parasite [@hector2019], and, as examined in our study, an arthropod host with an arthropod parasite [@agosta2018]. These studies generally reported a negative effect of parasitism on CT~max~, although in several cases confidence intervals overlapped zero (Figure 3). It's worth noting that each of the five previous studies included in this analysis examined the effect of parasites on their final host, while *A. tonsa* is the intermediate host for this isopod.

# Discussion

We observed that parasitism does not have a strong negative effect on the thermal limits of *Acartia tonsa* females. This was contrary to our hypothesis that infestation would decrease copepod thermal limits. These findings were also contrary to the results of previously published studies on the effects of parasitism on the critical thermal limits of a host.

The pattern observed is strongly affected by whether we include or exclude three notably lower thermal limit measurements in the infested treatment. The attached bopyrids varied in size within this treatment. Assuming individuals are not switching hosts, this means that females with larger bopyrids are likely older than females with smaller bopyrids. Visual inspection before the beginning of the experiment indicated that the three individuals with particularly low thermal limits were hosting larger bopyrids; the low thermal limits may therefore reflect the older age of these females. It's also possible that the effect of infestation increases with parasite size or developmental stage [Pike pers. comm. in @marshall1972], and that isopod parasitism has stage-specific effects on host thermal limits. As we were opportunistically measuring the effects of bopyrids, we lacked the required equipment to take photographs of these individuals and their bopyrids while CT~max~ measurements were being made and are unable to test for this correlation between larval length and host CT~max~. These dynamics are worth further examination in more targeted studies. Also worth examining are the relative effects of infestation on the thermal limits of other copepod species. While *A. tonsa* commonly serves as the intermediate host of bopyrid isopods, other species have also been observed to be infested by larvae [@owens1995; @pike1961; @uye1997]. Both variation in the effects of parasitism across species [@hatcher2006; @hatcher2008] and differences in thermal sensitivity [@willett2010] can have strong effects on community dynamics by reducing or intensifying competitive interactions.

The lack of a strong negative effect of parasitism on CT~max~ in *A. tonsa* was contrary to our hypothesis that infection would reduce thermal limits. It's possible that infestation stimulated the production of heat shock proteins [@frank2013; @encomio2007; @yang2022; @yu2021], a key component of the copepod heat stress response [@rahlff2017; @schoville2012]. We question, however, whether perhaps our initial hypothesis should have instead been that parasitism would not reduce the thermal limits of an intermediate host species. Parasites often have complex life cycles, relying on one or more intermediate hosts before infecting their final host. In a variable thermal environment, reduction of host thermal limits by infection could disrupt the parasite's development if temperature fluctuations result in host mortality. It may be beneficial, therefore, for parasites to manipulate host physiology in such a way to make these disruptions less likely [@lefevre2008]. Aphids serving as a vector for a plant virus (analogous to an intermediate host), for example, had increased thermal limits, allowing them to exploit warmer microhabitats than competitors, aiding in the spread of the virus [@porras2020]. In animal parasites, shifts in host preference toward warmer temperatures [@bates2011] or more exposed, illuminated sites [@macneil2003] may also contribute to shifts in temperature tolerance via acclimation effects. Given the necessity of a pelagic intermediate host for the successful development of this isopod, from an evolutionary perspective, it may make sense that infestation would not reduce host thermal limits.
