# Introduction

Copepods play important roles in coastal marine systems. *Acartia tonsa* is an especially prominent species across the Western Atlantic [@turner1981]. This species is also the intermediate host for a range of parasitic isopods (REF), some of which have substantial impacts on commercial species (REF). Less well known are the direct effects of the larval ectoparasites on the copepod hosts. Previous work has shown that parasitism by isopod larvae reduces metabolic rates in *A. tonsa* [@anderson1975]. In other species of copepods, parasitism by isopod larvae induces infertility [@uye1997]. In rapidly warming coastal systems (REF), parasitism-induced reductions in host thermal limits may have substantial effects on food web and biogeochemical dynamics.

While collecting a plankton sample from Key Largo Florida in late February 2023 (water temperature: 27 degrees C; salinity: 27 psu), we observed a substantial abundance of adult *A. tonsa* females that bore epicaridean and microniscan larvae of a bopyrid isopod (Figure 1). Given the important role *Acartia* copepods play in coastal systems, we wanted to test the hypothesis that infestation by bopyrid isopod larvae would reduce thermal limits in *Acartia tonsa*.

After collection, the contents of the plankton tow were maintained at 22 degrees C. An aquarium bubbler was used to ensure constant aeration. Mature *Acartia tonsa* females were sorted from the bulk contents of the plankton tow. Females with a bopyrid isopod larva attached to their prosome were set aside. Individual thermal limits were measured in batches of 10 (5 each, with and without isopods), as critical thermal maxima (CT~max~). During these assays, individuals were isolated in glass tubes with 10 mL of \_-um filtered seawater (collected from the same location as the copepods). These tubes were held in a plexiglass water bath, attached to a 20 L reservoir. The reservoir contained a 300 watt aquarium heater, which raised the temperature of the water in the reservoir at a constant rate of 0.1-0.3 degrees C per minute [@sasaki2021; @harada2019; @jiang2009]. An aquarium pump in the reservoir was used to flood the water bath, resulting in gradual warming of the water in the tubes. Copepods were continuously monitored until they ceased to respond to gentle stimulus (water movement caused by rotating the tube). The temperature at that point was recorded as the CT~max~. Four separate CT~max~ assays were run, one per day starting the day after copepods were collected.

The CTmax values for the two groups (infected and non-infected) were compared using mean difference as an effect size estimate. Confidence intervals were estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping [@ho2019]. Since multiple replicate experiments were run and CTmax may have changed as time since collection increased, we also ran a linear mixed effects model, with CTmax modeled as a function of infection status with experimental replicate as a random effect.

Contrary to expectations, we did not observe a decrease in thermal limits in the infected copepods (Figure 2). Instead, the observed effect of bopyrid parasitism on CT~max~ was slightly positive, with a confidence interval that strongly overlapped zero (mean difference: 0.102 [95CI -0.211; 0.353]). The linear mixed effect model also indicated no effect of bopyrid infestation. This result is strongly affected by three substantially lower thermal limits among the parasitized individuals. When these are removed, there is a small positive effect of infection (mean effect: 0.295 [95CI 0.0983; 0.509]). With the three low values removed, the linear mixed effects model also indicates an effect of bopyrid infestation on CTmax.

In both cases (no difference or a small increase in thermal limits), this is contrary to our expectations that bopyrid infestation would reduce copepod thermal limits. The pattern observed is strongly affected by whether we include or exclude three notably lower thermal limit measurements in the infested treatment. The attached bopyrids varied in size within this treatment. Assuming individuals are not switching hosts, this means that females with larger bopyrids are likely older than females with smaller bopyrids. The three individuals with particularly low thermal limits had larger bopyrids; the low thermal limits may therefore reflect the older age of these females. However, unfortunately without proper equipment we were unable to take photographs of these individuals and their bopyrids in order to measure lengths to test for a correlation between thermal limit and parasite size.

There are several potential explanations for an increase in thermal limits when parasitized. It's possible that HSP production is stimulated by infestation, thus priming copepods to respond to heat stress. Alternatively, previous work shows reduced respiration rates in *Acartia* infested by bopyrids. Reduced basal metabolisms may improve thermal tolerance. Reduced metabolism may also hinder the thermal stress response though if ATP limitation affects the production of HSPs.
